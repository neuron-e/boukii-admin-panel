# 🚀 Boukii Admin Panel - Test Execution Guide

## Quick Start - Just Run All Tests!

### Option 1: Run All Tests Automatically (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (fastest)
npm run cypress:run

# Run all tests with custom runner (with detailed progress)
node cypress/run-all-tests.js --headless

# Run all tests with Chrome browser
node cypress/run-all-tests.js --chrome --headless
```

### Option 2: Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Bug fixes validation (run this first!)
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/bug-fixes-validation.cy.ts"

# Core functionality tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/course-management.cy.ts"
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/booking-management.cy.ts"
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/user-management.cy.ts"

# Integration tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/scheduler-integration.cy.ts"
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/financial-management.cy.ts"
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/system-settings.cy.ts"

# Performance and complete workflow
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/performance-and-integration.cy.ts"
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/complete-workflow-validation.cy.ts"
```

### Option 3: Run with Visual Interface (for debugging)
```bash
# Open Cypress Test Runner
npm run cypress:open

# Or with custom runner
node cypress/run-all-tests.js
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### 1. Application Must Be Running
```bash
# Start the application first
npm start
# Application should be running on http://localhost:4200
```

### 2. Test Environment Setup
- ✅ Cypress is already installed (`cypress: ^13.6.0`)
- ✅ All test scripts are configured in package.json
- ✅ Test data fixtures are ready
- ✅ Custom commands are implemented

### 3. Required Data Attributes
The tests use `data-cy` attributes for reliable element selection. If tests fail due to missing elements, check the `DATA_ATTRIBUTES_GUIDE.md` for required attributes.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Tests Fail Due to Missing Elements
```bash
# Check if data-cy attributes are present
grep -r "data-cy=" src/
```
**Solution**: Add missing `data-cy` attributes following the guide in `DATA_ATTRIBUTES_GUIDE.md`

#### 2. Application Not Running
```bash
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4200
```
**Solution**: Start the application with `npm start` and wait for it to be ready

#### 3. Authentication Issues
```bash
# Tests might fail if login doesn't work
```
**Solution**: Update login credentials in `cypress/support/commands.ts`

#### 4. Timing Issues
```bash
# Elements not found due to loading
```
**Solution**: Tests include proper waits, but you may need to increase timeouts in `cypress.config.ts`

#### 5. Database State Issues
```bash
# Tests fail due to existing data
```
**Solution**: Tests are designed to be idempotent, but you may need to reset test data

## 📊 Interpreting Test Results
